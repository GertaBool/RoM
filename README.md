The reviewed revision contains 252 Python files, 956 XML files and 277 native source/header files. The review combines whole-tree structural analysis with focused behavioral inspection. The existing regression suite has 12 passing programs and 2 failing programs. The BTS executable and a complete headless simulator were not run.

The reports include fixed-revision source links, a state-transition model, deterministic replay requirements, engine boundaries and proposed tests. The machine-readable inventories and review scripts are in `docs/review/`.
